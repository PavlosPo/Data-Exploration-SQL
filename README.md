There are two tables 1. CovidDeaths table which contains the nescessary information to extract information about deaths
                     2. CovidVaccinations table which contains data irellevant to the deaths , such as diabetes, e.t.c.

It provides Queries from the original dataset downloaded from the https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths , where I try to gain some interesting insights about the Covid-19 pandemic. Questions arrise such us; does income affects the death rate per country, does the age? what other factors do exists?
